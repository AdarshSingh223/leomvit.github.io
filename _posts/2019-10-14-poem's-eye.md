**Poem's eye**  
Sometimes a lover,  
Sometimes a hater.  
On feelings I hover,  
Which he can't cater.  

Tell me Who are you  
In this world of smiles,  
Saying Love is a hue  
And emotion are crimes.  

YEAH harsh words when u sober  
go hate yourself over the wine,  
U got money go get over  
go spend a dime.  

highs to lows  
lows to highs  
vunerability sucks  
yet it thrives  

Now reading seems an issue  
And writing poems a weakness in fights  
For him i am the morning dew  
Which vanishes in afternoon so bright  

inked in black,  
writen at night.  
I'ma be the slack,  
with the morning light.      

but have hope ,u a adorer,  
so what a prisoner in cage of mind  
see i'ma poem which is over  
just look for smiles and u ll find.
