excerpt: When life hits you hard

what do you mean when you say i want a stable life is it mental peace is it steady wealth or what else.......this is the question that keeps haunting me everytime i dream of my future.i keep wondering what should be my life goal:a life that makes me happy and fills every moment with a smile or a life full of struggle which finally may bear me a fruit that is called "being remembered".....this is not the first time i am confessing this ....   i have kept asking different people i meet  so that i get a clear cut goal. but no one could actually satisfy my hunger for the answer.
        when this question first came to my mind was in class 11. my father has always been my first guide in every issue so i asked him about this....this time his answer came but was rather another question in a form of answer....as he said "depends on what makes you more happy".....now this new question gets added to my search list....what exactly is happiness?...from a very tender age i have been taught that everything in a limit is good but happiness always lied in breaking the rules..... but later that mostly had a real bad aftermath...so then?how can you say following happiness brings stability?...after this my journey changed its topic to where true happiness lies...
   i started searching my answer everywhere in books, legends ,lifestories of saints,their preachings, successfull people and even our religious text books........each had different text but meaning was the same....happiness in giving up and renunciation..now i was really interested in knowing how this renunciation actually gave happiness. it was my 12th ...........to be continued
