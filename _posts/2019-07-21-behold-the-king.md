**Behold the king**, don't let him die \
Cause I can't see the queen cry\
She would give up, won't aim so high\
Behold the king, don't let him die


After all, his wife is the love of mine\
Her eyes inviting like a glass of wine\
But instead of adieus, she prays the
king is fine\
So behold him my friend, let his armour shine


The sword through his heart, holding
him so still\
A sight she can't bear, she never will\
My aim never was, neither now is to kill\
To have the queen to myself, was my
only thrill

Protect your king, let his flag hoist high

I1ove my queen enough than to make her cry\
We can't undo things, so I'd better not try\
Before doomed be her fate, behold the king,\
**let me die.**
